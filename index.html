<h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hi, i'm Tommaso Pellegrini</strong></h1>
<p><span style="color: #00ff00;">This page is made for the applications i will and already are published on the iOs app store or the Android store. For further informations read below&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>iOS AppStore:&nbsp;</h3>
<p>All app posted on the iOS store follows the appstore standards and rules. Apps that contains any kind of monetization or are paid apps will have only content that i made or are royalty free. Those applications will never use any kind of copyrighted content and therefore they are 100% under Tommaso Pellegrini &copy; copyright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apps that are free under the "get" options and do not contain any kind of monetization, in app purchase or subscription may contain material that is under copyright which is not mine, but if that happens, it will be&nbsp;<strong>only&nbsp;</strong>under the form of&nbsp;<em>fair use</em><em>.&nbsp;</em>Additionally, every and all content that could be present in any of my apps, other that being fair use, will be in the form of Parody.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the fair use states:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><header>
<h3 class="entry-title">Fair Use</h3>
</header>
<div class="content">
<div class="entry-content">
<p>In its most general sense, a fair use is any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work. Such uses can be done without permission from the copyright owner. In other words, fair use is a defense against a claim of copyright infringement. If your use qualifies as a fair use, then it would not be considered an infringement.</p>
<p>So what is a &ldquo;transformative&rdquo; use? If this definition seems ambiguous or vague, be aware that millions of dollars in legal fees have been spent attempting to define what qualifies as a fair use. There are no hard-and-fast rules, only general guidelines and varied court decisions, because the judges and lawmakers who created the fair use exception did not want to limit its definition. Like free speech, they wanted it to have an expansive meaning that could be open to interpretation.</p>
<p>Most fair use analysis falls into two categories: (1) commentary and criticism, or (2) parody.</p>
<h3>Commentary and Criticism</h3>
<p>If you are commenting upon or critiquing a copyrighted work&mdash;for instance, writing a book review&mdash;fair use principles allow you to reproduce some of the work to achieve your purposes. Some examples of commentary and criticism include:</p>
<ul>
<li>quoting a few lines from a Bob Dylan song in a music review</li>
<li>summarizing and quoting from a medical article on prostate cancer in a news report</li>
<li>copying a few paragraphs from a news article for use by a teacher or student in a lesson, or</li>
<li>copying a portion of a <em>Sports Illustrated</em> magazine article for use in a related court case.</li>
</ul>
<p>The underlying rationale of this rule is that the public reaps benefits from your review, which is enhanced by including some of the copyrighted material. Additional examples of commentary or criticism are provided in the examples of fair use cases.</p>
<h3>Parody</h3>
<p>A parody is a work that ridicules another, usually well-known work, by imitating it in a comic way. Judges understand that, by its nature, parody demands some taking from the original work being parodied. Unlike other forms of fair use, a fairly extensive use of the original work is permitted in a parody in order to &ldquo;conjure up&rdquo; the original.</p>
